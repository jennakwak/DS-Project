# Dimension Reduction of Biomass Production Data

**Proejct Description** <br>
This project is to conduct a 'Dimension Reduction' process to select appropriate features to refine predictive modeling for ecological research.

**Conducted method for Dimension Reduction** 
1. Stepwise regression <br>
2. Ridge Regression(PCR) <br>
3. Subset Selection <br>

For each method, VIF and Condition Index were used to evaluate the collinearity between the features.
